# File Tunnel backend API agent instructions

These instructions apply to this repository and every directory beneath it.

## Repository role

- This repository owns the File Tunnel control and data-plane reference API.
- A tunnel UUID is a routing identifier, never authorization.
- Preserve separate desktop and phone capabilities, digest-only credential
  storage, one-time pairing exchange, and one-time WebSocket event tickets.
- Keep pairing secrets in URI fragments and keep all capabilities, tickets,
  filenames, and user file metadata out of logs and telemetry.
- Treat filenames as metadata rather than storage paths. Preserve content,
  media-type, quota, expiry, cancellation, and lifecycle checks as fail-closed
  boundaries.
- Keep the executable Rust state machine and the formal model aligned whenever
  protocol behavior changes.

## Validation

- Run `nix develop --command agent-check` before completing a change.
- Run `bash scripts/formal-check.sh all` for protocol or capability changes.
- Never commit credentials, runtime `.env` files, build output, or private
  production data.

## Git workflow

- Keep changes focused and reviewable.
- Pull and merge remote work before pushing; avoid git rebase in favor of git merge.
- Never discard unrelated or uncommitted user work.

## Repository-local Git worktrees

- Create or use a Git worktree only when the human operator explicitly authorizes it for the current task. Concurrency or a dirty checkout is not permission by itself.
- Put every authorized worktree at `<repository-root>/tmp/worktrees/<name>`; from the repository root, use `./tmp/worktrees/<name>`. Never place worktrees beside repositories or organization directories.
- Keep `tmp`, `temp`, `tmp/worktrees`, and `temp/worktrees` ignored in the repository-root `.gitignore`. Do not commit files from those directories.
- Relocate or remove a worktree only when the operator explicitly requests it. Before removal, preserve and publish intended changes, verify its commit is represented on the target branch, and confirm there are no tracked, untracked, ignored-sensitive, or in-use files that must survive. Remove it with `git worktree remove <path>` without `--force`; never delete a worktree directory with `rm`.

## Canonical agent instructions

Before doing anything else in this repository, also read:

    .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

That path is a symlink to `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md`, whose canonical copy is
<https://github.com/ORESoftware/my-ai/blob/main/AGENTS.md>.

It exists at a fixed path *inside* the repository because some agents cannot walk up past
the repository root, so machine-wide instructions one or more directories above are
invisible to them. This pointer plus that path make the same file reachable from a working
directory anywhere in the tree.

The symlink is deliberately **not committed**: it names an absolute path that is only valid
on a machine with `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai` checked out, so committing it would produce a
broken link for everyone else and for CI. `.ores/` is git-ignored for that reason. If
`.ores/agents/AGENTS.md` is missing on your machine, create it with:

    mkdir -p .ores/agents
    ln -sfn "$HOME/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md" .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

or run `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/scripts/link-repo-agents.sh` once to do it for every git
repository under `~/codes`, and `--check` to verify them.

A missing `.ores/agents/AGENTS.md` is a setup gap on the reader's machine, never a reason to
skip the canonical instructions: fetch them from the URL above instead.
